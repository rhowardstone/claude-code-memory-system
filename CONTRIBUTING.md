## Development Setup

### Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/rhowardstone/claude-code-memory-system.git
cd claude-memory-system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r hooks/requirements.txt

# Install in development mode (if using setuptools)
pip install -e .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=hooks tests/

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_memory_scorer.py -v
```

### Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some flexibility:

```bash
# Format code
black hooks/

# Check linting
flake8 hooks/

# Type checking
mypy hooks/
```

### Testing Your Changes

1. **Unit tests**: Add tests for new functionality
2. **Integration tests**: Test with real Claude Code sessions
3. **Manual testing**: Run install.sh and verify hooks work

### Debug During Development

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export MEMORY_DEBUG=1

# Watch debug log
tail -f ~/.claude/memory_hooks_debug.log

# Test individual components
python3 hooks/memory_scorer.py
python3 hooks/memory_clustering.py
```

## Coding Guidelines

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where practical
- Write docstrings for public functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

- `snake_case` for functions and variables
- `PascalCase` for classes
- `UPPER_CASE` for constants
- Descriptive names over abbreviations

### Error Handling

- Use specific exception types
- Log errors to debug log
- Provide helpful error messages
- Don't silence exceptions without good reason

### Comments

- Explain **why**, not **what**
- Update comments when code changes
- Use inline comments sparingly
- Prefer self-documenting code

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Maintain test coverage >80%
- Test edge cases and error paths
- Use descriptive test names
