    Yeah central to *the current task at hand* is kinda the idea yeah

    Great! And what would you do next? What's working, what isn't?
    Were those memories more relevant to your query? Does that mirror the sessionStart hook?
    Can you trigger a compaction? IF not, can you check manually what the new "relevant memories"
    *would* be to say, this moment in the convo, or up to the last compaction, if that's allowed?

    Yeah you'll need to clear and re-establish all memories, then shouldn't the hooks do that for
    future sessions? What about sessions I have already running?

    Yeah those like 'what it gives' for the transcript for the relevant memories isn't all too useful,
    it's like fragments

    hierarchical information -- like.. imaging we are "the human" just scrolling through and trying
    to navigate for any individual task -- but we want yeah some kind of *access* to the full transcript,
    even if that's not what the model auto-gets, but with the query system could easily access,
